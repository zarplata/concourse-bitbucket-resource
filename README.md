  type: git-bitbucket-pr
  source:
    base_url: http://bitbucket.local
    username: some-username
    password: some-password

      private_key: {{git-repo-key}}

jobs:

    plan:    
      - get: my-repo-with-pull-requests
        trigger: true
        version: every
      - task: unit test
          ...
          inputs:

            state: FAILED
            name: "unit test"
            url: "http://acme.com/teams/$BUILD_TEAM_NAME/pipelines/$BUILD_PIPELINE_NAME/jobs/$BUILD_JOB_NAME/builds/$BUILD_NAME"
        on_success:
          put: my-repo-with-pull-requests
          params:
            state: SUCCESSFUL
            name: "unit test"

```

## Behavior

### `check`: Check for changes to all pull requests.

The current open pull requests fetched from Bitbucket server for given 
project and repository. Update time are compared to the last fetched pull request.

If any pull request are new or updated or removed, a new version is emitted.

### `in`: Fetch the commit that changed the pull request.

This resource delegates entirely to the `in` of the original Git resource, by
specifying `source.branch` as the branch that changed, and `version.ref` as the
commit on the branch.

All `params` and `source` configuration of the original resource will be
respected.

### `out`: Update build task status.
  		  
This updates the build status of the task.
